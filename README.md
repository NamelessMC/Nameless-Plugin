## Compiling

Requirements: Maven, Git, JDK 11, JDK 17 (only required for paper and sponge9)

On Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install maven git openjdk-11-jdk openjdk-17-jdk`

You can also use any newer version of the JDK, but that means the compiled plugin won't be compatible with older Java versions.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless-Java-API
cd Nameless-Java-API
mvn clean install # Uses JDK 11
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless-Plugin
cd Nameless-Plugin
mvn clean package # Uses JDK 11 and 17
# find jar in {bungeecord,paper,spigot,sponge7,sponge8,sponge9,velocity}/target/*
```

Building the entire project can take quite a long time. You might want to build a single module only:
```sh
mvn package -pl velocity -am
```
